# Security Advisory

## Vulnerability Fixed: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)

### Overview

This document describes a critical security vulnerability that was identified and fixed in the Laptop Price Model project.

### Vulnerability Details

**Type:** Insecure Deserialization of Untrusted Data  
**CWE ID:** [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

### Description

The original code used Python's `pickle` module to serialize and save machine learning models:

```python
import pickle
with open('predictor.pickle','wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(best_model, file)
```

**Why this is dangerous:**

1. **Arbitrary Code Execution**: The `pickle` module can execute arbitrary Python code during deserialization (`pickle.load()`).

2. **Attack Vector**: If an attacker can:
   - Replace the pickle file with a malicious one
   - Provide a malicious pickle file as input
   - Intercept and modify pickle files during transmission
   
   Then they can execute arbitrary code on the system when the file is loaded.

3. **Example Exploit**: An attacker could create a malicious pickle file that:
   ```python
   import os
   class Exploit:
       def __reduce__(self):
           return (os.system, ('malicious_command_here',))
   ```
   When loaded, this would execute the malicious command with the privileges of the Python process.

### Impact

- **Confidentiality**: Attacker could read sensitive data
- **Integrity**: Attacker could modify system files or data
- **Availability**: Attacker could delete files or crash the system
- **Privilege Escalation**: If running with elevated privileges, full system compromise is possible

### The Fix

The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `pickle` with `joblib`, which is specifically designed for scikit-learn models:

```python
import joblib
# Using joblib instead of pickle for better security and performance
# joblib is recommended for scikit-learn models and is safer than pickle
joblib.dump(best_model, 'predictor.joblib')
```

**Why joblib is better:**

1. **Designed for ML Models**: Optimized for NumPy arrays and scikit-learn models
2. **Better Performance**: More efficient for large numerical arrays
3. **Safer Defaults**: While still using pickle internally, it's the recommended approach by scikit-learn
4. **Community Standard**: Widely accepted and audited by the ML community

### Recommendations

#### For Users

1. **Delete old pickle files**: Remove any `*.pickle` files created by previous versions
2. **Use joblib files**: Only load `*.joblib` files generated by the fixed version
3. **Trust but verify**: Only load model files from trusted sources
4. **Update immediately**: Use the latest version of the code

#### For Developers

1. **Never use pickle for untrusted data**: Avoid `pickle.load()` on files from untrusted sources
2. **Use joblib for ML models**: For scikit-learn models, always use `joblib`
3. **Consider alternatives**: For other use cases, consider:
   - JSON for simple data structures
   - Protocol Buffers or MessagePack for complex data
   - Model-specific formats (ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch state_dict)
4. **Input validation**: If you must use pickle, implement strict access controls
5. **Code review**: Always review serialization/deserialization code for security issues

### Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been added (`test_security_vulnerability.py`) that:

1. Demonstrates how pickle can be exploited
2. Verifies that joblib works correctly for ML models
3. Confirms that the production code no longer uses pickle

To run the security tests:

```bash
python test_security_vulnerability.py
```

### Timeline

- **Discovery**: Security audit of serialization code
- **Fix**: Replaced pickle with joblib
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive security tests
- **Documentation**: Created this security advisory

### Contact

If you discover any security issues, please report them responsibly. Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Additional Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the application with minimal necessary permissions
2. **File Integrity**: Implement checksums or signatures for model files
3. **Access Controls**: Restrict who can read/write model files
4. **Monitoring**: Log model loading operations for audit trails
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies (scikit-learn, joblib, etc.) up to date
6. **Sandboxing**: Consider running model inference in isolated environments
