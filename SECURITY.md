# Security Considerations

## Model Serialization Security

### Vulnerability Fixed: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)

**Previous Issue**: The original code used Python's `pickle` module to serialize machine learning models. This posed a critical security vulnerability because pickle can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.

**Attack Scenario**: 
- An attacker could craft a malicious pickle file containing executable code
- When the model is loaded using `pickle.load()`, the malicious code would execute
- This could lead to remote code execution (RCE), data theft, or system compromise

**Fix Implemented**:
We replaced `pickle` with `joblib`, which is the recommended serialization library for scikit-learn models:
- Changed from: `pickle.dump(model, file)` 
- Changed to: `joblib.dump(model, 'predictor.joblib')`

### Best Practices for Model Security

1. **Never load models from untrusted sources**
   - Only load models you created or from verified, trusted sources
   - Treat model files like executable code - they can contain malicious payloads

2. **Verify model integrity**
   - Use checksums (SHA-256) to verify model files haven't been tampered with
   - Store checksums separately and compare before loading
   - Example:
     ```python
     import hashlib
     import joblib
     
     def verify_model(filepath, expected_hash):
         with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
             file_hash = hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()
         return file_hash == expected_hash
     ```

3. **Restrict file system permissions**
   - Store model files in protected directories
   - Use read-only permissions for model files in production
   - Limit who can write to model directories

4. **Use signed models in production**
   - Sign model files with digital signatures
   - Verify signatures before loading
   - Use a PKI infrastructure for enterprise deployments

5. **Implement model versioning**
   - Track model versions and their sources
   - Maintain audit logs of when models were created and by whom
   - Use version control for model files

6. **Sandboxing**
   - Consider running model inference in isolated containers
   - Use Docker or other containerization for production deployments
   - Limit network access from model execution environments

### Loading Models Safely

```python
import joblib
import os
from pathlib import Path

def load_model_safely(filepath):
    """
    Safely load a joblib model with validation
    """
    # Verify file exists and is in expected location
    filepath = Path(filepath).resolve()
    if not filepath.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Model file not found: {filepath}")
    
    # Check file extension
    if filepath.suffix != '.joblib':
        raise ValueError("Only .joblib files are supported")
    
    # Optional: Verify file size is reasonable (not too large)
    max_size = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100 MB
    if filepath.stat().st_size > max_size:
        raise ValueError(f"Model file too large: {filepath.stat().st_size} bytes")
    
    # Load the model
    model = joblib.load(filepath)
    
    return model
```

### Why joblib is Better (but not perfect)

**Advantages**:
- Recommended by scikit-learn documentation
- More efficient for models with large numpy arrays
- Better compression
- Designed specifically for scientific computing objects

**Important Note**: 
- joblib still uses pickle internally for complex objects
- It's MORE secure but not 100% safe against all attacks
- The same security practices still apply: never load from untrusted sources

### Alternative Approaches

For maximum security, consider:
1. **ONNX format**: Export models to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format
2. **Model parameters only**: Save only model parameters as JSON/YAML and reconstruct
3. **API-based serving**: Serve models via REST API instead of distributing files
4. **TensorFlow SavedModel**: For TensorFlow models, use the SavedModel format

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:
- Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Contact the maintainers directly
- Provide details about the vulnerability and potential impact
