Security Test: Demonstrating the fix for insecure pickle deserialization

This test demonstrates that:
1. The original pickle vulnerability is no longer present
2. We now use joblib for secure model serialization
3. The exploit attempt is mitigated

VULNERABILITY: CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data
ORIGINAL ISSUE: Using pickle.dump/pickle.load for model serialization
FIX: Replaced with joblib.dump/joblib.load
