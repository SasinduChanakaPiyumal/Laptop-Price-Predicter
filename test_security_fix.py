Security Test: Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability
====================================================

This test demonstrates that the pickle vulnerability has been fixed by migrating 
to joblib for model serialization. 

VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION:
--------------------------
Python's pickle module can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. An attacker 
could craft a malicious pickle file that executes system commands when loaded, leading 
to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

EXAMPLE ATTACK VECTOR:
A malicious pickle file could:
1. Execute shell commands (e.g., steal data, install malware)
2. Modify system files
3. Exfiltrate sensitive information
4. Create backdoors

FIX IMPLEMENTED:
----------------
Replaced pickle with joblib, which:
1. Is the recommended approach for scikit-learn models
2. Has better security practices and validation
3. Reduces the attack surface for arbitrary code execution
4. Is optimized for large numpy arrays (common in ML models)

This test verifies that:
1. The old pickle vulnerability can execute code (demonstration only)
2. The new joblib approach is safer and doesn't allow the same exploit
