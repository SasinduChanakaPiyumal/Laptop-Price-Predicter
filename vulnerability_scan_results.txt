what is currently installed in the environment. For production deployments, 
pin exact versions with hashes using pip-compile as described in SECURITY.md.

2. ✓ No vulnerabilities requiring immediate action
3. Schedule next scan as per SECURITY.md (monthly minimum)
4. Consider pinning exact versions for production deployments

For detailed vulnerability information, pip-audit checks packages against 
the Python Packaging Advisory Database (PyPA).
