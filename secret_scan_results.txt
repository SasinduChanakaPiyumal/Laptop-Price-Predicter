ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
============================================================

✓ SCAN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The secret scan analyzed the full Git repository history across all 220 commits
and found NO hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens, or other sensitive
credentials.

Scan Coverage:
- All commits in repository history (--log-opts="--all")
- All branches
- All file types (.py, .ipynb, .csv, .txt, .md, etc.)

Types of secrets checked:
✓ API Keys (AWS, Azure, Google, OpenAI, etc.)
✓ Private Keys (RSA, SSH, PGP, etc.)
✓ Authentication Tokens (GitHub, GitLab, JWT, etc.)
✓ Database Connection Strings
✓ Passwords and Credentials
✓ OAuth Client Secrets
✓ Encryption Keys
✓ Webhook Secrets

Manual Verification Performed:
In addition to the automated gitleaks scan, manual pattern searches were
conducted to verify the results:

1. Searched for "password", "passwd", "pwd" patterns:
   → Only found template text in SECURITY.md (expected)

2. Searched for "api_key", "apikey" patterns:
   → No results found

3. Searched for "secret", "token", "private_key" patterns:
   → Only found template text in SECURITY.md (expected)

4. Searched for private key headers (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY):
   → No results found

5. Searched for GitHub token patterns (ghp_, gho_, ghu_, ghs_, ghr_):
   → No results found

6. Searched for OpenAI API key patterns (sk-...):
   → No results found

7. Searched for long hexadecimal strings (potential keys):
   → No results found

8. Checked Python files for:
   - HTTP/HTTPS URLs with embedded credentials
   - Environment variable access (os.environ, getenv)
   - Hardcoded credentials
   → No issues found

Code Review Findings:
The Python code files analyzed contain only:
- Data processing operations (pandas, numpy)
- Machine learning model training (scikit-learn, xgboost)
- Local file I/O operations (reading laptop_price.csv)
- No network operations
- No authentication mechanisms
- No credential management

============================================================
CONCLUSION:
============================================================

✅ REPOSITORY IS CLEAN

No secrets, API keys, passwords, or other sensitive credentials were detected
in the repository history. The codebase follows good security practices:

✓ No hardcoded credentials
✓ No API keys in source code
✓ No private keys committed
✓ No connection strings with passwords
✓ No authentication tokens

This is consistent with the project's nature as a local machine learning
analysis tool that:
- Operates on local CSV data
- Performs no network operations
- Requires no external API authentication
- Contains no production credentials

Recommendation: ACCEPTED - No remediation required
