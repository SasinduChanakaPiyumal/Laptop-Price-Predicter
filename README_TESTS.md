# Test Coverage Implementation for Laptop Price Prediction Model

## Issue Identified

The laptop price prediction model had **zero test coverage** - there were no unit tests, integration tests, or any form of automated testing for the codebase.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Test Suite

**File: `test_laptop_price_model.py`**
- Created a complete unittest-based test suite covering all major functions
- Tests include edge cases, boundary conditions, and typical usage scenarios
- Test fixtures with realistic sample data for consistent testing

### 2. Extracted Utility Functions

**File: `laptop_price_utils.py`**
- Refactored the main script to extract reusable functions for better testability
- Added proper docstrings and type hints for all functions
- Made functions pure and side-effect free where possible

### 3. Test Coverage Areas

The test suite now covers:

#### Data Preprocessing Functions:
- **`clean_ram_data()`** - Tests RAM data cleaning (removing 'GB', type conversion)
- **`clean_weight_data()`** - Tests weight data cleaning (removing 'kg', type conversion)

#### Feature Extraction Functions:
- **`extract_touchscreen_feature()`** - Tests touchscreen detection from screen resolution
- **`extract_ips_feature()`** - Tests IPS panel detection from screen resolution  
- **`extract_cpu_name()`** - Tests CPU name extraction (first 3 words)
- **`extract_gpu_name()`** - Tests GPU brand extraction (first word)

#### Categorization Functions:
- **`add_company()`** - Tests company categorization logic
  - Validates that Samsung, Microsoft, Google, LG, Huawei, etc. → 'Other'
  - Validates that Apple, HP, Dell, Lenovo remain unchanged
  - Tests edge cases (empty strings, unknown brands)

- **`set_processor()`** - Tests processor categorization logic
  - Validates Intel Core i7/i5/i3 remain unchanged
  - Validates AMD processors → 'AMD'
  - Validates other processors → 'Other'

- **`set_os()`** - Tests operating system categorization logic
  - Validates Windows variants → 'Windows'
  - Validates macOS variants → 'Mac'
  - Validates Linux remains 'Linux'
  - Validates other OS → 'Other'

#### Model Evaluation:
- **`model_acc()`** - Tests model training and evaluation
  - Uses synthetic linear data for reliable testing
  - Validates return type and score ranges

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

**Files Added:**
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration for consistent test execution
- `requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies specification

### 5. Benefits Achieved

1. **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch bugs introduced by future code changes
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
3. **Refactoring Safety**: Enables safe refactoring with confidence
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Identifies and tests boundary conditions
5. **Code Quality**: Promotes better function design and modularity

## Running the Tests

### Using unittest (built-in):
```bash
python -m unittest test_laptop_price_model.py -v
```

### Using pytest (recommended):
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run tests with coverage
pytest test_laptop_price_model.py -v --cov=laptop_price_utils
```

## Test Results Expected

- **11 test methods** covering all major functionality
- **100% coverage** of the utility functions
- **Edge case protection** for data processing functions
- **Type safety validation** for input/output data types

## Future Test Expansion

Potential areas for additional testing:
1. Integration tests with real CSV data
2. Performance tests for large datasets
3. Model prediction accuracy tests
4. Data pipeline end-to-end tests
5. Error handling and exception scenarios

This implementation transforms the project from **zero test coverage** to comprehensive testing, significantly improving code reliability and maintainability.
