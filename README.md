# Project Setup

To set up your development environment, please follow these steps:

1.  **Run the setup script**:

    Execute the `setup_env.sh` script to create a Python virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies. If the virtual environment already exists, the script will prompt you to remove it manually if you wish to recreate it.

    ```bash
    bash setup_env.sh
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:

    The `setup_env.sh` script will automatically activate the virtual environment upon completion. If you open a new terminal or need to reactivate it later, use the following command:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Deactivate the virtual environment**:

    When you are finished working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment using:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
