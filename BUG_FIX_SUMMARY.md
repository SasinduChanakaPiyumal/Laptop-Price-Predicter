# Bug Fix Summary: Laptop Price Model

## Bug Identified
**Location**: Line 256 in `Laptop Price model(1).py`  
**Type**: SyntaxError  
**Issue**: The script contained a raw pip install command (`pip install scikit-learn`) which is not valid Python syntax.

## Root Cause
The script appears to be converted from a Jupyter notebook (evident from the `# In[X]:` comments), and during conversion, the pip install command that should have been run in a terminal/command line was mistakenly included as a Python statement.

## Bug Impact
- **Before Fix**: The script would fail to run entirely due to SyntaxError at line 256
- **Severity**: Critical - prevents the entire script from executing
- **Error Message**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` when trying to run or import the script

## Fix Applied
**Change**: Commented out the problematic line
```python
# Before:
pip install scikit-learn

# After: 
# pip install scikit-learn  # This should be run in terminal/command line, not in Python script
```

## Verification
The fix was verified through comprehensive unit tests in `test_laptop_price_model.py`:

### Test Cases Created:
1. **`test_script_can_be_compiled_after_patch`**: Verifies the script compiles without SyntaxError after the patch
2. **`test_pip_install_line_is_commented`**: Confirms the problematic line is properly commented out
3. **`test_script_basic_structure_intact`**: Ensures the fix didn't break the script's structure
4. **`test_pip_install_causes_syntax_error`**: Demonstrates the original bug with a minimal example
5. **`test_commented_pip_install_works`**: Shows how commenting fixes the issue

### Test Results:
- **Before Patch**: Script would throw SyntaxError and fail to compile
- **After Patch**: Script compiles successfully without syntax errors

## Files Modified:
1. `Laptop Price model(1).py` - Line 256: Commented out the pip install command
2. `test_laptop_price_model.py` - Created comprehensive unit tests
3. `BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Instructions for Users:
To use this script, users should:
1. Install required packages via terminal: `pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy`
2. Then run the Python script normally

The fix ensures the script can be executed while maintaining all original functionality.
