Performance Benchmark: Storage Feature Extraction Optimization

This script benchmarks the performance improvements made to the storage 
feature extraction and screen resolution parsing in the laptop price model.

Bottlenecks identified and fixed:
1. Storage feature extraction (lines 288-293): Was doing 6 passes instead of 1
2. Screen resolution extraction (lines 150-152): Was doing 3 passes instead of 1

These optimizations specifically target the worst bottlenecks in the
feature engineering pipeline:

1. Storage Feature Extraction (lines 288-293):
   - OLD: 6 passes through the data (1 apply + 5 apply on results)
   - NEW: 1 pass + lightweight list comprehensions
   - Impact: ~{:.0f}% faster for this operation

2. Screen Resolution Extraction (lines 150-152):
   - OLD: 3 passes through the data (3 separate apply calls)
   - NEW: 1 pass + lightweight list comprehensions
   - Impact: ~{:.0f}% faster for this operation

Memory Benefits:
- Reduced intermediate Series objects (old method created 6 Series)
- More efficient memory usage with list comprehensions
- Better cache locality with single-pass operations

Why This Matters:
- Feature engineering is the #1 bottleneck in data preprocessing
- These operations run on every training iteration
- Speedup compounds when running hyperparameter search (60 iterations)
- For larger datasets (10k+ rows), savings would be even more significant
