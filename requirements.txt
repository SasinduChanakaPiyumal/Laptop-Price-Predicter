#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with Python 3.11
# by the following command:
#
#    pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
#
# NOTE: This is a template. Run the following commands to generate actual hashed dependencies:
#
#   pip install pip-tools
#   pip-compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt requirements.in
#   pip-sync requirements.txt
#
# For now, this contains unpinned versions as a starting point.
# IMPORTANT: Generate hashes before deploying to production.

numpy>=1.24.0
pandas>=2.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
xgboost>=2.0.0

# Dependencies will be auto-resolved when pip-compile is run
# The above command will add all transitive dependencies with SHA256 hashes
