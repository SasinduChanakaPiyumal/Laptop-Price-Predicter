# Tests to skip globally (none for now). Add IDs here to suppress proven false positives.
# Common examples that teams sometimes skip: B101(assert), B601(paramiko), etc.
# Keep this empty initially to maximize coverage and adjust over time.
skips: []

# Targets: optional explicit glob patterns. By default Bandit will analyze provided paths.
# We keep default behavior and run `bandit -r .` in CI to cover all Python files.
